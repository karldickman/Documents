\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } (hereinafter referred to as
``Landlord'') and \underline{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } (hereinafter referred to as ``Tenant'').
For and in consideration of the covenants and obligations contained herein and

hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
\section{Property}

lease a bedroom (hereinafter referred to as the ``Room'') in the Property to
Tenant upon the terms and conditions contained herein. Tenant desires to lease
the Room from Landlord on the terms and conditions as contained herein.
\section{Term}
\label{sec:Term}
This Lease Agreement shall commence on
\underline{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } and shall continue
as a lease for term. The termination date shall be on
\underline{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } at 23:59.
\subsection{Early Termination}
\label{sec:early-termination}
If at any time the Tenant desires to terminate this Lease Agreement, the Tenant
may do so by providing the Landlord written notice of intentional to terminate
at least 7 days prior to the desired Termination Date of this Lease
Agreement. Notices to terminate may be given on any calendar day, irrespective
of Commencement Date. Time is of the essence when providing notice of
termination (strict compliance with dates by which notice must be provided is
required).
\subsection{Vacating Property}
Upon Termination Date, Tenant shall be required to vacate the Property unless
one of the following circumstances occur:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Landlord and Tenant formally extend this Lease Agreement in writing or
        create and execute a new, written, and signed  Lease Agreement; or
    \item Landlord willingly accepts new Rent from Tenant, which does not
        constitute past due Rent; or
    \item Tenant remains in possession of the Room with the written consent of
        Landlord after the natural expiration of this Lease Agreement.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Month-to-month Tenancy}
In the event that Landlord accepts new rent from Tenant after the termination
date, or the Tenant remains in possession of the Room with the written consent
of the Landlord, a month-to-month tenancy shall be created. If at any time the
Landlord desires to terminate the month-to-month tenancy, the Landlord may do so
by providing to the Tenant written notice of intention to terminate at least
30 days prior to the desired date of termination of the month-to-month tenancy.
Notices to terminate may be given on any calendar day, irrespective of
Commencement Date. Rent shall continue at the rate specified in this Lease
Agreement, or as allowed by law. All other terms and conditions as outlined in
this Lease Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Time is of the
essence for providing notice of termination (strict compliance with dates by
which notice must be provided is required).
\section{Rent}
Tenant shall pay to Landlord the sum of
\$\underline{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } per month as Rent for the Term of the
Agreement. Due Date for Rent payment shall be the \underline{\ \ \ \ } day of
each calendar month and shall be considered advance payment for that month.
Weekends and holidays do not delay or excuse Tenant's obligation to timely pay
rent.
\subsection{Delinquent Rent}
If not paid on the Due Date, Rent shall be considered overdue and delinquent on
the \underline{\ \ \ \ } day of each calendar month. If Tenant fails to timely
pay any month's rent, Tenant will pay Landlord a late charge of
\$\underline{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } per day until rent is paid in full. The
Landlord may, at his discretion, agree, in writing, to waive late charges. Any
waiver of late charges under this paragraph will not affect or diminish any
other right or remedy Landlord may exercise for Tenant's failure to timely pay
rent.
\subsection{Prorated Rent}
In the event that the Commencement Date is not the 1st day of the calendar month,
Rent payment remitted on the Commencement Date shall be prorated based on the
length of the calendar month.

In the event that the Termination Date, is not the last day of the calendar
month, Rent payment remitted on the Due Date shall be prorated based on the
length of the calendar month. In the event that the Tenant terminates the lease
early under the provisions of Section \ref{sec:early-termination}, and the
Termination Date specified by the Tenant is not the last day of the calendar
month, the Rent payment shall be prorated based on the length of the calendar
month.
\subsection{Returned Checks}
In the event that any payment by Tenant is returned for insufficient funds
(``NSF'') or if Tenant stops payment, Tenant will pay
\$\underline{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } to Landlord for each such check, plus late
charges, as described above, until Landlord has received payment. Furthermore,
Landlord may require in writing that Tenant pay all future Rent payments by
cash, money order, or cashier's check.
\subsection{Order in which funds are applied}
Landlord will apply all funds received from Tenant first to any non-rent
obligations of Tenant including late charges, returned check charges,
charge-backs for repairs, brokerage fees, and periodic utilities, then to rent,
regardless of any notations on a check.
\subsection{Rent Increases}
There will be no rent increases through the Termination Date. If this lease is
renewed automatically on a month to month basis, Landlord may increase the rent
during the renewal period by providing written notice to Tenant that becomes
effective the month following the 30th day after the notice is provided.
\section{Security Deposit}
Upon execution of this Lease Agreement, Tenant shall deposit with Landlord the
sum of \$\underline{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } (which amount is not in
excess of two months periodic rent) receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by
Landlord, as security for any damage caused to the Property during the term
hereof. Landlord may place the security deposit in an interest bearing account
and any interest earned will be paid to Landlord or Landlord's representative.

deposit may be applied to the payment of accrued rent and the amount of damages

orders of any and all governmental or quasi-governmental authorities affecting
the cleanliness, use, occupancy and preservation of the Property.
